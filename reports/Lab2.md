# Determinism in Finite Automata. Conversion from NDFA to DFA. Chomsky Hierarchy.

### Course: Formal Languages & Finite Automata
### Author: Bajenov Sevastian

## Theory
If needed, but it should be written by the author in her/his words.


## Objectives:

1. Understand what an automaton is and what it can be used for.

2. Continuing the work in the same repository and the same project, the following need to be added:
    a. Provide a function in your grammar type/class that could classify the grammar based on Chomsky hierarchy.

    b. For this you can use the variant from the previous lab.

3. According to your variant number (by universal convention it is register ID), get the finite automaton definition and do the following tasks:

    a. Implement conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar.

    b. Determine whether your FA is deterministic or non-deterministic.

    c. Implement some functionality that would convert an NDFA to a DFA.
    
    d. Represent the finite automaton graphically (Optional, and can be considered as a __*bonus point*__):
      
    - You can use external libraries, tools or APIs to generate the figures/diagrams.
        
    - Your program needs to gather and send the data about the automaton and the lib/tool/API return the visual representation.


## Implementation description

* About 2-3 sentences to explain each piece of the implementation.


* Code snippets from your files.

```
public static void main() 
{

}
```

* If needed, screenshots.
